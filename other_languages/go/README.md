## Go Development Environment Setup

This guide will help you set up and run a Go program.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Go: [Download and install Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Running a Go Program

1. To run the Go program, open the integrated terminal.

2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your Go file is located using the `cd` command.

3. Finally, use the `go run` command followed by the name of your Go file to run the program. For example:

    ```shell
    go run main.go
    ```

    The output of your Go program will be displayed in the terminal.

That's it! You now have a Go development environment set up in VSCode and know how to run a Go program.

Happy coding!
